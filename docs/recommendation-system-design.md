# E-commerce Advanced Recommendation System - Design Document

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the design of an advanced recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. The system recommends products to users based on their browsing/purchase history, similar users' behaviors, and contextual signals.

## 2. Data Structures

### 2.1 Core Data Models
We will implement recommendation system based on the following core data models:

```python
class User:
    """User information model."""
    def __init__(self, user_id, name, location, device):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.name = name
        self.location = location
        self.device = device

class Product:
    """Product information model."""
    def __init__(self, product_id, name, category, tags, rating):
        self.product_id = product_id
        self.name = name
        self.category = category
        self.tags = tags
        self.rating = rating
        
class Interaction:
    """Model for user-product interactions."""
    def __init__(self, user_id, product_id, interaction_type, timestamp, quantity=None):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.product_id = product_id
        self.interaction_type = interaction_type  # 'view', 'purchase'
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.quantity = quantity  # Only relevant for purchases
        
class ContextualSignal:
    """Model for contextual signals."""
    def __init__(self, category, peak_days, season):
        self.category = category
        self.peak_days = peak_days
        self.season = season
```

### 2.2 Storage Structure
To optimize for both retrieval speed and memory efficiency:

- User, Product, and ContextualSignal information will be stored in dictionaries for O(1) lookup
- For interactions, we'll maintain indexed structures:
  - User-to-interactions map
  - Product-to-interactions map
  - Timestamp-based partitioned data for time-sensitive recommendations

## 3. Algorithm Design

Our recommendation system will employ a hybrid approach combining:

### 3.1 Collaborative Filtering
- **User-Based**: Find similar users and recommend products they interacted with
- **Product-Based**: Find similar products based on user interaction patterns

### 3.2 Content-Based Filtering
- Recommend products similar to those the user has previously interacted with
- Use product tags, categories, and metadata for similarity calculations

### 3.3 Contextual Boosting
- Adjust recommendation scores based on time of day, day of week, season, and device type
- Factor in product popularity within the current context

### 3.4 Recommendation Pipeline

1. **Candidate Generation**
   - Generate candidates from multiple sources:
     - Previously viewed but not purchased products
     - Products purchased by similar users
     - Popular products in categories of interest
     - Seasonal trending products

2. **Scoring**
   - Score each candidate based on:
     - User-product affinity (from collaborative filtering)
     - Content similarity
     - Contextual relevance
     - Recency and frequency of interactions

3. **Diversity Enhancement**
   - Ensure diversity in recommendations by:
     - Limiting the number of products from the same category
     - Introducing some controlled randomness
     - Using a category-aware ranking algorithm

4. **Final Ranking**
   - Combine all scores and diversity considerations
   - Return the top N products

## 4. Key Components

### 4.1 Data Processor
Responsible for loading and preprocessing user, product, and interaction data.

### 4.2 Similarity Calculator
Computes similarities between users and between products.

### 4.3 User-Based Recommender
Generates recommendations based on similar users' behaviors.

### 4.4 Item-Based Recommender
Generates recommendations based on similar products.

### 4.5 Contextual Booster
Adjusts recommendation scores based on contextual signals.

### 4.6 Diversity Enhancer
Ensures diversity in the final recommendation list.

### 4.7 Recommendation Manager
Orchestrates the entire recommendation process.

### 4.8 Explanation Generator
Provides explanations for why a product was recommended.

## 5. Optimization Techniques

### 5.1 Caching
- Cache user similarity matrix
- Cache product similarity matrix
- Cache frequent recommendation results

### 5.2 Pre-computation
- Pre-compute user similarities during off-peak hours
- Pre-compute product similarities
- Maintain rolling popularity scores

### 5.3 Parallel Processing
- Parallelize similarity computations
- Parallelize candidate generation from different sources

### 5.4 Dimensionality Reduction
- Use matrix factorization to reduce the dimensionality of user-item interaction data
- Cluster users and products to reduce computation complexity

## 6. Cold Start Handling

### 6.1 New Users
- Recommend popular products
- Recommend seasonal products
- Recommend based on limited demographic information

### 6.2 New Products
- Recommend to users who purchased similar products
- Boost visibility based on product metadata
- Integrate into category-based recommendations

## 7. Explainability

We will implement explanation generation based on:
- Collaborative filtering reasons ("Users similar to you liked this")
- Content-based reasons ("Based on your interest in [category]")
- Contextual reasons ("Trending in your area")
- Historical reasons ("You viewed this but didn't purchase")

## 8. Trade-offs

### 8.1 Accuracy vs. Diversity
- Higher accuracy may lead to less diverse recommendations
- We'll balance this with controlled introduction of diversity

### 8.2 Recency vs. Consistency
- Recent interactions might not reflect long-term preferences
- We'll apply time decay to balance recent and historical signals

### 8.3 Computation vs. Freshness
- Pre-computation improves performance but may use stale data
- We'll implement incremental updates and set appropriate refresh intervals
